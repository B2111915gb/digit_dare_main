# Digit Dare
This is my version of famous Wrodle puzzle, that I used to play in school as a child.

## Rules
- The program thinks of a random 5 digit number.
- We get some number of attempts to guess the number.
- Everytime we guess a number, we are told how many (not which ) of the digits are in correct place and how many belongs to the guess but not in correct position.
- After few hits and trails and deducing from the hints, you need to guess the Number.

Sounds Simple ? Try it....
Sounds Fun ? Try it.......
